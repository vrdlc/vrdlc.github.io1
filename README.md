##Description
Epicodus is a coding school in Portland, OR. This project, our final work for the first week of class, involved building a portfolio landing page using all of the things we learned over the previous four days. 

##Setup
######Clink this link or type it into your browser bar: [vrdlc.github.io] (vrdlc.github.io)
Currently there is only a landing page, but there are links to my GitHub repositories. These links will eventually be updated to actual project pages, but for now you can look at my code. 

#Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Javascript
* Git
And, of course,
* a text editor and
* a terminal
